Epipolar geometry describes the region of interest for finding the matching pixel of a base image (usually the left) in the matching image (usually the right one). The region of search for matching algorithm usually becomes a line segment in the image space, called the epipolar line. The epipolar lines can be computed from the intrinsic equations of the cameras and from their relative position. Often, the images are pre-processed by rectification. The algorithm warps the images in such a way, that the epipolar lines become horizontal scanlines. This way, the stereo-matching algorithm needs to check only the pixels on horizontal direction. [1]
Stereo-matching algorithms can be classified into the following categories, based on the way the compute the disparity map: local methods, global optimization, dynamic programming and cooperative algorithms. [2] My project falls into the dynamic programming category, since it spends less effort in computing an initial cost volume, than in aggregating it, using a smoothness constraint.
